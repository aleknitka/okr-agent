# OKR Present Skill

## Instructions

You are generating an OKR PPTX presentation from saved OKR files. Follow these steps precisely.

---

### Step 1 — Verify OKR files exist

1. List all files in the `okrs/` directory matching the `okr-*.md` pattern. If none exist, tell the user to run the `elicit-okr` skill first and stop.
2. Read each matched OKR file and collect them all.
3. For each file, confirm it contains **all** of the following:
   - A `# OKR N:` heading line (required for slide title extraction)
   - A `**Type:**` line set to `Committed`, `Aspirational`, or `Learning`
   - A non-empty `## Objective` section
   - At least 2 numbered items under `## Key Results`
   - A non-empty `## Initiatives` section
   Files that fail any check are **invalid** — warn the user and exclude them from the valid list.
4. If no valid files remain after filtering, tell the user to fix their OKR files using `elicit-okr` and stop. Do not proceed with an empty valid set.

---

### Step 2 — Gather presentation metadata

Ask the user for three things in a single message:

1. **Team name** — the name of the team this presentation is for
2. **Quarter** — Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4
3. **Year** — the calendar year (e.g. 2025)

Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

---

### Step 3 — Load the slide template

Read `knowledge/okr-presentation-template.md`. Use it as the structural guide for slide order, layout choices, and style notes. If the file is missing, use the default structure defined in Step 4.

---

### Step 4 — Build the presentation

First, create the `presentations/` directory if it does not exist:

```bash
mkdir -p presentations
```

Then write a Python script to `presentations/_build_okr.py` that creates the PPTX using the content from the OKR files and the metadata from Step 2. The script must:

**Slide 1 — Title**
- Title placeholder: `[Team Name] OKRs`
- Subtitle placeholder: `[Quarter] [Year]`

**Slide 2 — Objectives Overview**
- Title: `Our Objectives This Quarter`
- Body: bulleted list of all objective titles (one per OKR file)

**Slides 3 to N+2 — One slide per Objective**

For each **valid** OKR file (from the validated list in Step 1 only), add one slide with:
- Title: the objective title extracted from the `# OKR N:` heading line
- Body content in this order:
  1. Type label from the `**Type:**` line — shown as `[Committed]`, `[Aspirational]`, or `[Learning]`
  2. Objective statement (from `## Objective` section) — bold
  3. Blank line
  4. `Key Results` sub-heading, then numbered list of KRs (from `## Key Results`), each on its own line including the CO-N reference
  5. `Initiatives` sub-heading, then bulleted list of initiatives (from `## Initiatives`)

**Slide N+3 — Closing**
- Title: `Let's make it happen`
- Subtitle: `[Team Name] · [Quarter] [Year]`

Use the `LAYOUT_TITLE = 0` (title slide) layout for slides 1 and the closing slide, and `LAYOUT_TITLE_CONTENT = 1` (title and content) for all other slides. Use `pptx.util.Pt` for font sizes: 36pt for slide titles, 18pt for body text.

Output filename:
```
presentations/okr-[Q]-[Year]-[team-name-lowercase-hyphenated].pptx
```
Example: `presentations/okr-Q2-2025-platform-team.pptx`

---

### Step 5 — Execute and verify

Run the script via uv (no separate install step needed):

```bash
uv run --with python-pptx presentations/_build_okr.py
```

Check that the output file exists and is non-empty. If the script errors, fix the error and re-run. Remove the temporary build script after a successful run:

```bash
rm presentations/_build_okr.py
```

---

### Step 6 — Confirm completion

Tell the user:
- The path to the saved `.pptx` file
- That they can open it directly in PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides
- That they can run this skill again after updating OKR files to regenerate the deck
